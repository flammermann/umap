## 2.0.0 - 2024-02-16

This release is inauguring a new era in versionning uMap: in the future, we'll take care of better documenting breaking changes, so expect more major releases from now on. More details on [how we version](https://docs.umap-project.org/en/master/release/#when-to-make-a-release).

The main changes are:

* on the front-end side, we now use native ESM modules, so this may break on old browsers (see our [ESlint configuration](https://github.com/umap-project/umap/blob/a0634e5f55179fb52f7c00e39236b6339a7714b9/package.json#L68))
* on the back-end, we upgraded to Django 5.x, which drops support for Python 3.8 and Python 3.9.
* the OpenStreetMap OAuth1 client is not supported anymore (now deprecated by OpenStreetMap.org)
* license switched from WTFPL to AGPLv3: having an OSI valid licence was a request from our partners and sponsors (#1605)

More details below!

### Breaking changes

* updrade to Django 5.x drops support for Python < 3.10
* `django-compressor` has been removed, so `umap compress` is not a valid command anymore (compress is now done in the `collectstatic` process itself) (#1544, #1539)
* removed support for settings starting with `LEAFLET_STORAGE_` (deprecated since 1.0.0)
* removed support for deprecated OpenStreetMap OAuth1 backend in favour of OAuth2 (see below)
* `FROM_EMAIL` setting is replaced by `DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL`, which is [Django standard](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/ref/settings/#default-from-email)

#### Migrate to OpenStreetMap OAuth2

* create a new app on OSM.org: https://www.openstreetmap.org/oauth2/applications/
* add the key and secret in your settings (or as env vars):
    * `SOCIAL_AUTH_OPENSTREETMAP_OAUTH2_KEY=xxxx`
    * `SOCIAL_AUTH_OPENSTREETMAP_OAUTH2_SECRET=xxxx`
* if you changed `AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS`, you need to now use `"social_core.backends.openstreetmap_oauth2.OpenStreetMapOAuth2"`
* run the migration command, that will migrate all accounts from OAuth1 to Oauth2:
  `umap migrate`

## 1.0.0

### Upgrading to 1.0

- because of the merge of django-leaflet-storage inside umap, the migrations
  has been reset, so a bit of SQL needs to be ran by hand:

```sql
BEGIN;
DELETE FROM django_migrations WHERE app = 'leaflet_storage';
DELETE FROM django_migrations WHERE app = 'umap';
ALTER TABLE leaflet_storage_datalayer RENAME TO umap_datalayer;
ALTER TABLE leaflet_storage_datalayer_id_seq RENAME TO umap_datalayer_id_seq;
ALTER TABLE leaflet_storage_licence RENAME TO umap_licence;
ALTER TABLE leaflet_storage_licence_id_seq RENAME TO umap_licence_id_seq;
ALTER TABLE leaflet_storage_map RENAME TO umap_map;
ALTER TABLE leaflet_storage_map_editors RENAME TO umap_map_editors;
ALTER TABLE leaflet_storage_map_editors_id_seq RENAME TO umap_map_editors_id_seq;
ALTER TABLE leaflet_storage_map_id_seq RENAME TO umap_map_id_seq;
ALTER TABLE leaflet_storage_pictogram RENAME TO umap_pictogram;
ALTER TABLE leaflet_storage_pictogram_id_seq RENAME TO umap_pictogram_id_seq;
ALTER TABLE leaflet_storage_tilelayer RENAME TO umap_tilelayer;
ALTER TABLE leaflet_storage_tilelayer_id_seq RENAME TO umap_tilelayer_id_seq;
COMMIT;
```

- Then fake initial migrations:

        umap migrate --fake-initial

- If you have customized some templates, change any `leaflet_storage/` path
  to `umap/`

- If you have customized some static, change any `storage/` path
  to `umap/`

- Each `LEAFLET_STORAGE_XXX` setting should be renamed in `UMAP_XXX` (but we
  still support them for now)

- If you still have a `MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES` setting, rename to `MIDDLEWARE`

- uMap now loads the local configuration from /etc/umap/umap.conf if
  `UMAP_SETTINGS` is not set, so you may want to use that path and remove
  the env var setting

- As usual, remember to update statics:

        umap collectstatic
        umap compress
